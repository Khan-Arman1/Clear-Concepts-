    "# What are Constructors in Java and C++?\n",
    " \n",
    " * Constructors are the same name function in classes.\n",
    " * Constructor is invoked automatically when we create an object of a class.\n",
    " * Constructors initiallize the class objects.\n",
    " * Constructors setup the initial state of object.\n",
    " * They do not have a return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Allocation - \n",
    "\n",
    " * Memeory is allocated with the help of 'new' keyword. \n",
    " * In Java you explicitly type 'new' before assigning the class to object.\n",
    " * In C++ you mostly write.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What are Constructors in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    " * In python, Constructors are __ init __() methods.\n",
    " * But generally refer to the entire process how objects are create and initiallize.\n",
    " * **__ new __() Method -** \n",
    "     * Object creator.\n",
    "     * Python automatically executes a method called '__ new __()' that creates the object.\n",
    "     * '__ new __()' allocate memeory to the object.\n",
    "     * And that object have its unique memory address.\n",
    "     * Python automatically store reference of class in '__ new __()' method 'cls' argument.\n",
    " * **__ init __() Method -**\n",
    "     * After executing '__ new __()' python instantly execute ' __ init __()'.\n",
    "     * ' __init __()' initialize the object and provide state to objects.\n",
    "     * Python then store reference of the created object as a parameter in 'self' argument.\n",
    "* Methods and attributes of class provide behaviour to all the different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In Python objects are actually created in Heap.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Python store reference of objects?\n",
    "\n",
    " * Python does not expose memory location but provide reference to 'self/cls' or a variable.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * Example - Suppose you ordered a pizza and you that delivery partner ask you for your exact location but you guide the delivery partner to reach a landmark and you yourself collect pizza from him. Here you did not tell him your exact address but you referenced the address.\n",
    "     \n",
    " * Python actually use internally object reference system to access the data at that memory location.\n",
    " * Python creates a handle to reach that memory location and does not give the raw address.\n",
    " * In python classes, 'self' and 'cls' receive the reference(means handle) of the object and class.\n",
    "     * That reference is internally connected to the memeory address.\n",
    " * *handle* - way to reach out\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Python reference is different from C++ memory allocation?\n",
    " \n",
    " * As we know python uses a internally object reference system, a handle to reach that data.\n",
    " * But, in C++ we can access that memory location directly by use '&' operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - int x = 10;   \n",
    "              \n",
    "              cout << &x;   \n",
    "\n",
    "              Actual memory address\n",
    "\n",
    " * In Python, \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example - a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "              \n",
    "              b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "              Here a and b reference to the same memeory location."
